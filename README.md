GoSass
======

A fork of the official [gosass](https://github.com/moovweb/gosass) repo to fix cgo library and include paths for building.

Go language wrapper for LibSass (the C/C++ implementation of Sass).

For sample usage, see the file `gosass.go`. But make sure you move it to a different folder or comment it out before building, because the Go build tools don't like having two separate modules in the same folder!
